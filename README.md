# VR_Esclab
Esclab implements the idea of an Escape Labyrinth in Virtual Reality

Implementation: 

- small, moveable space where the player can build / destroy walls on certain positions
- while moving/acting, he/she produces noises which the enemy character(s) will hear and react to by coming closer
- the player has to remember the environment which will change during exploration (Spatial Orientation)
- The next task (which item and where to place the item is revealed during exploration)

Player:

- Will be able to build / destroy walls
- Will have to get around enemies / stop enemies to come closer
- Will have to get around potential noise factories (water puddles)
- Will have to collect items which need to be placed in certain places which the player has to find
    - Some items will have special effects like invincibility
- While the player is holding an item or building a wall, he/she cannot defend him/herself or doing vice versa
- The player can be hit a few times (visible/audible effect of heartbeat and vignette)


Enemys:

- Will be able to attack
- Will make noises themselves


Walls:

- Some walls with a special texture can be destroyed (glowing! :P)
- Walls can be created on any position

HUD:

- Health is visible on the hands of the player (maybe the insides)


Goal:

- A not so scary game where exploration and curiosity is the main focus
